This involves preprocessing text for BM25 and generating embeddings for vector search.\n\n2. **Indexing**: Use a search engine like Elasticsearch for BM25 indexing and a vector database (e.g., FAISS or Pinecone) for storing and querying embeddings.\n\n3. **Query Processing**: When a query is received, first process it to retrieve relevant documents using both methods:\n   - **BM25 Retrieval**: Use the traditional keyword-based search to get a list of documents based on exact matches.\n   - **Vector Retrieval**: Convert the query into an embedding and retrieve documents based on semantic similarity.\n\n4. **Combining Results**: Merge the results from both retrieval methods. You can rank them based on relevance scores from BM25 and similarity scores from the vector search, or use a weighted approach to balance their contributions.\n\n5. **Response Generation**: Feed the combined results into the generative model to produce a response that leverages the strengths of both retrieval methods.\n\nBy following these steps, you can effectively implement hybrid search in RAG systems, enhancing the quality and relevance of generated responses."}, {"time": "2026-02-03 11:17:03.044637", "user": "How does hybrid retrieval improve RAG systems?", "assistant": "Hybrid retrieval improves Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems by integrating traditional keyword-based methods, such as BM25, with vector-based approaches.
